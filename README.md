# [Project Name: e.g., Retail Sales Forecasting]

**Author:** TODO_STUDENT (Your Group Name or number)  
**Course:** MLOps: Master in Business Analytics and Data Sciense
**Status:** Session 1 (Initialization)

## 1. Business Objective
*Replace this section with your project definition.*

* **The Goal:** What business value does this model create?
  > *Example: Reduce food waste by 10% by predicting daily bakery demand.*

* **The User:** Who consumes the output and how?
  > *Example: Store managers receive a weekly PDF report on Monday mornings.*

---

## 2. Success Metrics
*How do we know if the project is successful?*

* **Business KPI (The "Why"):**
  > *Example: Reduce unsold inventory costs by $5,000/month.*

* **Technical Metric (The "How"):**
  > *Example: Model MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) < 15% on the test set.*

* **Acceptance Criteria:**
  > *Example: The model must outperform the current "moving average" baseline.*

## 3. The Data

* **Source:** (e.g., Company Database, Kaggle CSV, API).
* **Target Variable:** What specifically are you predicting/ classifying?
* **Sensitive Info:** Are there emails, credit cards, or any PII (Personally Identifiable Information)?
  > *⚠️ **WARNING:** If the dataset contains sensitive data, it must NEVER be committed to GitHub. Ensure `data/` is in your `.gitignore`.*

## 4. Repository Structure

This project follows a strict separation between "Sandbox" (Notebooks) and "Production" (Src).
